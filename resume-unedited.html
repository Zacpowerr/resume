    <h1>Eduardo Bastos</h1>
    <h2>Full Stack Developer</h2>
    <p>
      I am a life long learner, I have always found joy on exploring new fields
      and understanding how things work, from electronics to counter tops, I am
      fascinated in learning. I have spent most of my life working with
      computers, either by opening them up to see what is inside to how
      websites, apps, and the internet in general works. I proud myself on the
      fact that I am good that problem solving, independent from technologies or
      stacks. I like to approach the problems in a way that makes me truly
      understand what clients are going through, and finding a suitable
      solution. Over the near decade that I been learning and using programming
      to solve problems, I have come across multiple stacks and platforms, from
      my beginnings in Pascal to me current expertise with Javascript, Java,
      C++, and Python, I have learned and experienced a lot over the years. I
      have been assigned more entry level roles as Junior developer helping
      Seniors and not being part of the decision making process, to more client
      facing roles as Business Analyst and Project Coordinator for internal
      projects.
